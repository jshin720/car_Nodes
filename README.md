<!-- Car nodes

Background

This Car Nodes is a visualization of cars, car makers, and the countries of where the brands are from. The point of ‘project’ is so show interactively there what countries, car makers are from and the current cars that the car maker has. And to show the user information on cars visually and interactively. The ‘project’ will have levels:

1)	the top level being the county
2)	the 2nd level being the car maker
3)	3rd level being the cars 
4)	the last levle being the information of the specific car. 

Every level will be design as node or item that will enlarge when hovered over it. When the item is enlarged it will show branches of the next lower level and once clicked it will switch over to that lower level. Up until it gets to the lowest level where information on the specific car is. 


Functionality & MVPs

With his interactive & visualization, users will be able to :

•	Click on different buttons or nodes that will show the lower level of that respective level;
•	When the user gets to the car information level – it will show a picture of the current generation of the car and the information about that specific car. 
•	There will be a button to head back up a lvl or to the main level;
•	All the buttons or nodes will enlarge when hovered over them and/or change to a different color. 

In addition, Car nodes will include:
•	A production Readme

•	The nav links include links to this project’s Github repo, my LinkedIn and the About Modal
•	The back on the top of goes back one level and the Main goes back to the top level


Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
•	The Kelly blue API will supply the information for the cars
•	Canvas will be used for the design. 
•	WebPack to bundle and transpile the source JS code

Implementation Timeline

	NB:
•	Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen and speed time getting comfortable with the canvas api. 
•	Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic for Car nodes. Connecting each level with each other. 
•	Tuesday: Start using Canvas to design the nodes and the interactive aspect of the pages;
•	Wedneday: Finish implementing the interactive features and the designs of the page. 
•	Thursday Morning: Deploy to Github.   -->
