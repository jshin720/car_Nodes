This Car Nodes is a visualization of cars, car makers, and the countries of where the brands are from using D3.visualization. The point of ‘project’ is so show interactively in a tree node form  what countries, car makers are from and the current cars that the car maker has. And to show the user information on cars visually and interactively. The ‘project’ will have levels:

1)	the first level being the county
2)	the 2nd level being the car maker
3)	3rd level being the cars 
4)	the user is able to click on the car node to get more information

Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
•	D3 visualization will be used for the design. 
•	WebPack to bundle and transpile the source JS code

Implementation Timeline

	NB:
•	Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen and speed time getting comfortable with the canvas api. 
•	Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic for Car nodes. Connecting each level with each other. 
•	Tuesday: Start using Canvas to design the nodes and the interactive aspect of the pages;
•	Wedneday: Finish implementing the interactive features and the designs of the page. 
•	Thursday Morning: Deploy to Github.
